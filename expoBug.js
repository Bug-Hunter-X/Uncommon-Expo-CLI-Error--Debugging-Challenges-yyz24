This error typically occurs when there's a mismatch between the development environment setup (like Expo Go or a physical device) and the project's configuration.  For example, you might be trying to use a feature or library that isn't supported on the simulator or device, have incorrect dependencies, or haven't properly linked native modules.  It's also possible this arises from a conflict between different versions of Expo CLI, SDK, or React Native.
