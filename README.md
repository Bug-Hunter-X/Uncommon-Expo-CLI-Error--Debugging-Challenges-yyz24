# Uncommon Expo CLI Error: Debugging Challenges

This repository demonstrates a scenario where the Expo CLI throws a generic error, making debugging difficult. The error message lacks specifics, hindering the identification of the root cause.  The `expoBug.js` file contains the code exhibiting the problem, while `expoBugSolution.js` offers a possible solution, focusing on diagnosing similar issues.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install the dependencies.
4. Try to run the project using `expo start`.
5. Observe the generic error message. 

## Potential Solutions

The solution (`expoBugSolution.js`) illustrates a systematic approach to debugging.  This involves:

* **Checking Expo SDK Version Compatibility:** Ensure that your SDK version is compatible with the libraries and features you're using.
* **Dependency Conflicts:** Check for any conflicting packages or versions using tools like `npm ls` or `yarn why`.
* **Native Module Linking:** If you're using native modules, double-check that they're properly linked to your project.
* **Device/Simulator Compatibility:** Verify that the project's dependencies and features are supported by the device or simulator used for testing.
* **Clean and Rebuild:**  A clean build can resolve many issues.
* **Consult Expo Documentation:**  Review relevant sections of the Expo documentation to understand compatibility requirements and potential issues.
